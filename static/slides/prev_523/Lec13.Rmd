# Web APIs

## URLs

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/url-structure.png")
```

## Query Strings

Provides named parameter(s) and value(s) that modify the behavior of the resulting page. 

<br/>

Format generally follows:

<br />

.center[.large[

field1=value1&field2=value2&field3=value3

]]

--

<br/>

Some quick examples,

* `http://lmgtfy.com/?q=hello%20world`

* `http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?sensor=false&address=1600+Amphitheatre+Parkway`


---

## URL encoding

This is will often be handled automatically by your web browser or other tool, but it is useful to know a bit about what is happening

* Spaces will encoded as '+' or '%20'

* Certain characters are reserved and will be replaced with the percent-encoded version within a URL

.small[

| !   | #   | $   | &   | '   | (   | )   |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| %21 | %23 | %24 | %26 | %27 | %28 | %29 |
| *   | +   | ,   | /   | :   | ;   | =   |
| %2A | %2B | %2C | %2F | %3A | %3B | %3D |
| ?   | @   | [   | ]   |
| %3F | %40 | %5B | %5D |

]

* Characters that cannot be converted to the correct charset are replaced with HTML numeric character references (e.g. a &#931; would be encoded as &amp;#931; )

---

```{r}
URLencode("http://lmgtfy.com/?q=hello world")
URLdecode("http://lmgtfy.com/?q=hello%20world")
```

--

```{r}
URLencode("! # $ & ' ( ) * + , / : ; = ? @ [ ]")
URLdecode(URLencode("! # $ & ' ( ) *  + , / : ; = ? @ [ ]"))
```

--

```{r}
URLencode("Î£")
URLdecode("%CE%A3")
```

# RESTful APIs

---

## REST

**Re**presentational **s**tate **t**ransfer 

* describes an architectural style for web services (not a standard)

* all communication via http requests

* Key features: 
    - addressible
    - stateless
    - connected 
    - simple

---

## HTTP Methods / Verbs

* *GET* - fetch a resource.

* *POST* - create a new resource.

* *PUT* - update a resource.

* *DELETE* - delete a resource.

Less common verbs: *HEAD*, *TRACE*, *OPTIONS*.

---

## Status Codes

* 1xx: Informational Messages

* 2xx: Successful

* 3xx: Redirection

* 4xx: Client Error

* 5xx: Server Error

## Example 1: <br/> [An API of Ice And Fire](https://anapioficeandfire.com/)

---

## Documentation

While there is a lot of standardization, every API is different and you will need to review the documentation of each.

See documentation [here](https://anapioficeandfire.com/Documentation) for AAOIF.

## Pagination

> An API of Ice And Fire provides a lot of data about the world of Westeros. To prevent our servers from getting cranky, the API will automatically paginate the responses. You will learn how to create requests with pagination parameters and consume the response.
> 
> **Things worth noting**: <br/>
> Information about the pagination is included in the Link header
> Page numbering is 1-based
> You can specify how many items you want to receive per page, the maximum is 50
>
> **Constructing a request with pagination** <br/>
> You specify which page you want to access with the ?page parameter, if you don't provide the ?page parameter the first page will be returned. You can also specify the size of the page with the ?pageSize parameter, if you don't provide the ?pageSize parameter the default size of 10 will be used.

## Exercise 1

Using the AAOIF API answer the following questions:

1. How many characters are included in this API?

2. What percentage of the characters are dead?

3. How many houses have an ancestral weapon?
